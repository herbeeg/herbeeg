### Hi folks.
#### I'm currently working on:
- 🎮 Participating in game jams on [Itch](https://herbeeg.itch.io/), collaborating with and writing original music for other teams & entrants
- 🎹 Uploading 8/16-bit music covers in FamiTracker on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JonponsVids10)
- ✍️ Writing retrospectives about my game jam compositions and experiences [here](https://music.jonherbst.dev/blog)

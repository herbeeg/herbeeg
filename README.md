### Hi folks.
#### I'm currently working on:
- ⌨️ A TUI music tracker built upon the Python curses library, "Cobra Tracker"
- ⌨️ A custom vocal synthesiser heavily based around my own vocals that can morph and shape existing audio snippets to tune them to the required note and octave.
- 🎹 My next original album based on my experiences in Outland from the World of Warcraft franchise, "Outland: It burns, a lot"
- 🎹 Uploading original video game music and covers on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JonponsVids10)

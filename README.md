### Hi folks.
#### I'm currently working on:
- 🎮 Participating in game jams on [Itch](https://itch.io/jams), collaborating with and writing original music for other teams & entrants
- 🧰 [ft2vis](https://github.com/herbeeg/famitracker-export-converter), converting FamiTracker export data to a parsable format for [FT-Visualise](https://github.com/herbeeg/ft-visualise)
- 🧰 [FT-Visualise](https://github.com/herbeeg/ft-visualise), an audio visualiser built with Godot that renders video animations for music created in FamiTracker
- 🎹 Uploading 8/16-bit music covers in FamiTracker on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JonponsVids10)
- ✍️ Writing retrospectives about my game jam compositions and experiences [here](https://music.jonherbst.dev/blog)
